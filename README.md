## Overview

Built this design with an emphasis on SASS basics.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

1. Put thought on the basic structure of the page and elements that are grouped together and then placed empty semantic tags.

2. Put all of the elements then started styling (mobile-first) those elements starting from the background then the card itself from top to bottom.

3. Made it responsive with media queries.

4. Refactored stylesheet.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming convention

### What I learned

I mostly put emphasis on practicing the Sass preprocessor in this project. What I learned was that, despite the beautiful feature of Sass to nest declarations, I also must be careful using this feature. There were times where I think I overdone it making my actual CSS ugly.

### Continued development

I would like to focus on using the mixins and function features of SASS for my next projects. Also, I'm struggling with naming classes. I need to read more professionally written code to learn more about naming classes descriptively.
